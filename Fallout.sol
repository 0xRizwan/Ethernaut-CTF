// Vulnerabilities
// In older version of solidity, the contract name was used to create the constructor but the constructor name had to be exactly same as contract name. Here in smart contract if differs which can be easily hacked and take the ownership

// Recommended Mitigation steps
// In newer solidity versions, constructor as separate function is introduced. In older versions using this kind of contract architecture, make sure the contract name and constructor name are exactly equal.
